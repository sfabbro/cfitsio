This repackaging of cfitsio uses modern autotools (with compatibility
with old ones as well). It adds the following features:

* Shared and static libraries can be both properly configured. This is
 the standard libtool behaviour with all the advantages (static libs
 compiled without PIC, but shared libs yes)
* allow to compile without fortran easily (--disable-fortran)
* much more robust globus detection. (--with-gsiftp option)
* threading uses the standard autoconf macro ax_pthread.m4 (--enable-threads)
* binaries that everyone uses are now compiled by default (imcopy,...)
* testing now can be compiled and executed with "make check"
