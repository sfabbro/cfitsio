Repackaging of cfitsio
======================

If you are in a hurry, just run the following provided simple scripts:

   $ ./make-cfitsio-tarball.sh
   $ ./install-cfistio.sh


If you want to know a bit more, read below.

This repackaging of cfitsio uses modern autotools (with compatibility
with old ones as well). It adds the following features:

* Shared and static libraries can be both properly configured. This is
 the standard libtool behaviour with all the advantages (static libs
 compiled without PIC, but shared libs yes). The upstream cfitsio tar
 ball will not do this.
* binaries that everyone uses are now compiled by default (such as imcopy)
* allow to build cfitsio without fortran easily (--disable-fortran)
* much more robust globus ftp detection. (--with-gsiftp option)
* threading uses the standard autoconf macro ax_pthread.m4 (--enable-threads)
* testing now can be compiled and executed with "make check"
* use of more standard macros instead of handmade ones

To build cfitsio with this set of Makefile.am/configure.ac, do the
following:

1. Download the latest cfitsio version, untar it
2. Copy Makefile.am, configure.ac, ax_pthread.m4 into the cfitsio
directory
3. Run autoreconf -fvi
4. Then install with standard ./configure; make; make install


Note: ultimately, cfitsio should use the autoheader, and setting all
the define's in a config.h header, to be installed as well. This will
need more patching of the sources. Stay tune.
